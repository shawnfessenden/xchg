This is an XOR variable exchange demonstration. Two variables can be exchanged by XORing them together three times. This project is written in assembly language for Linux (more to demonstrate assembly than anything else, plus writing this in C would be pretty boring). I guess assembly language is getting to be a lost art form. I didn't realize this. I use it all the time (or, actually, I *read* it all the time: I'm constantly checking on my compilers to make sure they're not doing dumb things). IMO, this shouldn't become a lost art. There are a heckuva lot of situations where directly twiddling microprocessor bits becomes a huge advantage. Hopefully, the huge boost in popularity of linux in all kinds of small devices will revive this super fun world of messing with registers and shooting yourself in the foot so hard you loose more than just a toe.
